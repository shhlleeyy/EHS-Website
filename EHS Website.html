I gained the confidence to participate in many events and exited my comfort zone. I made friends along the way, and they are the best. It taught me many life lessons and how to manage my time. I am so thankful to have the opportunity to experience being an EHSIAN, and I couldnâ€™t ask for more."</i></p>
